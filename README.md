# Online Portfolio

Hello, my name is Connor Warren (they/them) and welcome to my portfolio page! 

## Personal Information
After graduating from Hillsdale College in 2022 I worked for Intel for two years as a data analyst intern. Presently, I am finishing up a Master's Degree in Data Science from Willamette University in Portland, Oregon. I am passionate about solving the problems facing us all today utilizing a wide range of techniques ranging from more traditional statistics to machine learning. Most of the work I have done since entering graduate school has focused on political problems and utilizing large amounts of publicly available data from places like the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau, and the FBI.

## Past Projects
### Project 1 
<a href="pdfs/Capstone_write_up.pdf" target="_blank">Capstone Immigration Project Write Up</a>

<a href="pdfs/ILRC Prez (2).pdf" target="_blank">Capstone Immigration Project Write Up</a>
This is the capstone project for my Data Science Master’s at Willamette University. My groupmate and I looked at the underlying patterns that relate immigrant populations, economic data, election returns, and the level of collaboration between federal immigration enforcement and local law enforcement. Of those featuers, we found that the composition of the state's Legislature is the most predictive. 

### Project 2
[CrimeApp](https://marcusapollo.shinyapps.io/CrimeApp/)
This project was an attempt to create an app that displays the crime rate at the county level in the United States by utilizing the FBI’s crime api. This project was undertaken during Q1 2025 as a way of preparing for the resumption of my Master’s Program after the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. The FBI’s data was at the level of the local law enforcement agency. Utilizing census data which relates cities to counties, I transformed the raw FBI data into crime rate by county for most counties in the United States. Then I created a ShinyApp which displayed the crime rate by state and includes cities for which I have data.

### Project 3
[PumpkinProject](https://github.com/MarcusApollo7/marusapollo7/tree/pages/projects/pumpkins)
This was the final project for one of my classes at my master’s program. One of the members of my group grows giant pumpkins as a hobby and she was interested in creating a better method than the one that is currently used to estimate the weight of the pumpkin based on a measure of its circumference called the OTT. Utilizing the R package caret and stochastic gradient boosting we were able to compute the size of the pumpkins based on OTT. In order to improve the accuracy, we found that the weight of the “mother” of the present pumpkin did not matter until the OTT of the pumpkins was sufficiently large. As a result of this, we created a purely OTT based model to be used for pumpkins with an OTT below 256 inches and a mixed OTT and mother’s weight model to be used for pumpkins with an OTT above 256 inches. We found that our model was about as accurate as the present model for pumpkins below the cutoff but much more accurate for those above the cutoff.
