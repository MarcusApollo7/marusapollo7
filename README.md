Personal Information
After graduating from Hillsdale College in 2022 and worked for Intel for two years as a data analyst intern. Presently, I am finishing up a Master's Degree in Data Science from Willamette University in Portland, Oregon. I am passionate about solving the problems facing us all today utilizing a wide range of techniques ranging from more traditional statistics to machine learning. Most of the work I have done since entering graduate school has focused on political problems and utilizing large amounts of publicly available data from places like the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Census Bureau, and the FBI.

This is the capstone project for my Data Science Masterâ€™s at Willamette University. I am presently working on this project but my partner and I have completed the data acquisition steps and have moved on to the analysis. We are looking at the underlying patterns that relate immigrant populations, economic data, election returns, and the level of collaboration between federal immigration enforcement and local law enforcement.
