This was the final project for one of my classes at my master’s program. One of the members of my group grows giant pumpkins as a hobby and she was interested in creating a better method than the one that is currently used to estimate the weight of the pumpkin based on a measure of its circumference called the OTT. Utilizing the R package caret and stochastic gradient boosting we were able to compute the size of the pumpkins based on OTT. In order to improve the accuracy, we found that the weight of the “mother” of the present pumpkin did not matter until the OTT of the pumpkins was sufficiently large. As a result of this, we created a purely OTT based model to be used for pumpkins with an OTT below 256 inches and a mixed OTT and mother’s weight model to be used for pumpkins with an OTT above 256 inches. We found that our model was about as accurate as the present model for pumpkins below the cutoff but much more accurate for those above the cutoff.
